Life's hard.

I work in an industry that is pressure filled and and timeline driven. It's classically lacking in work/life balance, but I can't put much blame on them for that. It's an industry that exploits gaps where it can, and I can't look anywhere beyond myself to see that I've allowed them a place to exploit. But that's a post for another time.

I'm currently in a space where I feel trapped. I've created a life that I once clamored for, but I'm now feeling the sqeeze of what I've created. Oof...
